# Find the index of key value in the array 

> Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
 - What approach did you take? iterative way in binary search way 
 - Discuss Why?  I used the iterative way because it's time complexity is so good
 - What is the Big O space/time for this approach?
    - Big O
       - Time Complexity :  
         - Best case complexity: O(1)
          the element we searched for is in the middle directly
         - Average case complexity: O(log n)
           The element we searched for is in the first index or last index or in random index expect the middle
         - Worst case complexity: O(log n)
      
       - Space complexity :
         - O(1) because I used the  iterative way
